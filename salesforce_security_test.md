**About:**
CEO, reMarkable

It’s like this collaboration that we’re seeing between agents and humans. It’s not us versus them; it’s we. Suddenly, it’s this way of working that lets teams move at their natural tempo. This is the perfect tool for a team to run at speed. Salesforce can deliver digital labor, and I get to wake up in the morning, thinking about customers.
